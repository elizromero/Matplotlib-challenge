# Matplotlib-challenge
In this challenge, a given dataset of different drug regimens for treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was analyzed. Each regimen was tested on mice, and the tumor volume for each one was tracked across different time points. Using the matplotlib and pandas libraries, I cleaned the dataset and conducted an analysis using a starter set of instructions to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the 'Capomulin' regimen.

You can find the main code in Pymaceuticals/main.ipynb. The given dataset and starter code are located in Pymaceuticals/Resources.
